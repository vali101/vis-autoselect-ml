# Notebook for data science autoselect. 

This is an experimental Project. The aim of this library is to autoselect visuaizations to evaluate machine learning models. 

## There are 3 levels of declaring your data 
1. No declaration just input the array `add_data(some_array)`
2. Declare Data with a label `add_data({score-values: some_array})`
3. Define inputdata by function call `add_predicition_score(some_array)`

## Visualize

After you have inputed all the data you can just call the `visualize()` function and it will generated all possible vissualizations.

### Try it yourself and explore examples
